            You thought this mission to the moon would be a quick six month
            thing. Your neighbor offered to look after your dog. Your high
            school math teacher was impressed. He once said you wouldn’t amount
            to anything.You sure showed him. But now here you are, fifty feet
            from your spaceship with no way to get back. Your dog will be so
            sad. Your math teacher will be so smug. Pretty devastating.

            The child had looked so excited when the clown had presented a large
            red balloon. You had seen this, but in the throes of your morning
            commute you didn’t register it until it was too late. Who asked the
            government to support a fair right through Main Street during a week
            day anyway? Your bike barrelled right between the child and the
            clown and sent the balloon on its merry way. You didn’t turn back to
            see the damage you had done. Later you saw the balloon floating
            outside your office window.

            You have never seen an ostrich head. Whenever you’re around it seems

          <p>
            A broken clock is right twice a day. But if you just have one clock,
            it’s impossible to tell exactly when the clock is right. So it could
            be right at any moment. And that brings you to the crux of the
            conceptualization. What is time? Nothing but an abyss. Clocks are
            just false attempts to harness its power. It’s cruel really.

          <p>
            The earthquake was not good to the bike lane on your way to work. A
            large gap in the pavement (too big to be called a pothole) had
            swallowed three oblivious bikers whole. So the city had put up two
            pylons and yellow caution tape. Pretty frustrating for you given
            your propensity to do 360 jumps over the gap.

            This mug was a family heirloom. Of your neighbor. Your neighbor
            always loved the color, shape, and quantity of coffee held by this
            mug. But your neighbor moved out and left it on their porch, no
            explanation, no repair materials, no nothing. So you have this

            Toast takes so long to make. You stare at the toaster tapping your
            feet. Your laundry is in the dryer and it just dinged. Maybe you’ll
            take it out. After all, you have time. You take out your laundry.
            You fold your underwear. You think about folding your socks. You
            remember your toast! It is too late. It’s burnt to a crisp. The
            process repeats itself. You should probably figure out your toasting
            settings.

            Gulp. You hold back tears as the white liquid spreads across the

            chocolate milk, it was clearly the better choice. And then maybe you
            wouldn’t have so carelessly smacked it across the room when you
            emphatically pointed at a bird outside. Too late now. You wipe the
            single tear from your eye and go fetch the mop.

            and a bottle of water and carried your camera for the money shot.
            But the map was from 2005 and the landscape had changed. So here you
            are, in the middle of a large field, that the map continues to claim
